This box will spin up a gluster volume for you on f19.



To implement it:

1) Install vagrant from http://downloads.vagrantup.com/

2) Clone this repo !

   git clone git@forge.gluster.org:vagrant/fedora19-gluster.git

3) cd into this repo !

   cd fedora19-gluster/

4) Create a symlink called "Vagrantfile" for the type of cluster you want.

   ln -s Vagrantfile_cluster Vagrantfile
   or
   ln -s Vagrantfile_singlenode Vagrantfile

4) run "vagrant up" (or, if on a newer version of vagrant run: "vagrant up --provision")

5) And ssh into your vm!   

   vagrant ssh 

7) Bask in the glory of your totally reproducible gluster dev environment!

8) Broke something? No problem.  Just run: 

   vagrant destroy && vagrant up

yay !

Over time we will add new Vagrantfile_* configurations.  To use them just 
copy them into "Vagrantfile" and run "vagrant destroy && vagrant up"

TODO: 

- testing on kvm
- testing on vmware
- adding other components of the hadoop ecosystem to support hadoop gluster plugin development
- testing on larger clusters
- making this production deployable i.e. to ec2 etc..
- fuse patch for higher concurrency support
